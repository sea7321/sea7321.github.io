## Welcome!
Welcome to my online portfolio! Currently, I am a 4th year Computer Science BS/Computing Security MS student studying at
Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). I am seeking a full-time opportunity for the summer of 2024 that focuses on red
team skill sets such as monitoring network security, conducting vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.
